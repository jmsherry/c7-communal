This is here to allow you to practice push-pull from a git repo. You'll need to:

1. Clone the repo
2. make some changes
3. add and commit
4. do a `git status` to see if other changes have been made
5. If there are no changes then `push`; otherwise `pull` (and then resolve any merge issues) and then `push`.
